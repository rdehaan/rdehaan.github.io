<h1>Charm: Communication, Habits, Awareness, Reflection, Mindset<br /><small>Reading &amp; discussion group at the UvA</small></h1>

<p>Organizer: <a href="https://staff.science.uva.nl/r.dehaan/">Ronald de Haan</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
  <b>General idea:</b> The idea of this group is to have discussions where we reflect together and exchange ideas about a particular topic. For each of the topics, we'll collect some pointers to (reading/listening) material that you can use to prepare and to spark some thoughts. If you don't have (much) time to prepare, feel free to come to a session and discuss anyway. Your participation is useful and interesting to everyone, regardless of your level of preparation. The point of this group is not to add yet another item to your to-do list. <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
</p>

<p>
  The topics often overlap, and they are a rich source of reflection and discussion. In our sessions, we can only scratch the surface. The goal is to spark further reflection and thought.

  <p>
    <b>Target audience:</b>
    The target audience for our sessions (currently) are tenure-trackers and assistant professors. The point of aiming at this audience is to ensure that our experiences don't diverge too much, and that as a result we can have an interesting and productive discussion within a limited amount of time. If you're (roughly) within this target audience, feel free to come to a session to see what it's like.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Topics and input:</b>
    Currently, the choice and order of topics is decided by <a href="https://staff.science.uva.nl/r.dehaan/">Ronald</a>, and he puts together the preparation material. There is generally a lot of flexibility in the choice and order of topics, so if you have preferences, get in touch!
    More generally, if you have suggestions for other material, topics, or other ideas, please get in touch.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Practicalities:</b>
    For each session, we will book a room somewhere on Science Park, roughly during lunch time. Bring your own lunch and/or coffee and tea. The discussion will take place in an informal (and still organized) setting where there is space to eat your lunch or drink your tea during the discussion, if you want to.

<div class="content">

  <p>
    A large portion of the time, we are not consciously deciding what to do, but we let our habits guide our behavior. This has advantages: having to consciously decide about every tiny action would take a lot of energy. It also has disadvantages, at times: some habits don't serve us (anymore). How to get insight into our habits? How to change them into habits that serve us better?

<div class="content">

  <p>
    Often the more you know about a topic or an area, the more you know that you don't know everything about it. This general tendency is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>. Related to this, many of us tend to doubt their skills and accomplishments, even with evidence to the contrary. This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor phenomenon</a>. This is a very common phenomenon (sometimes estimated to impact 70% of people at some point in their life), and is especially prevalent under underrepresented groups. How can we deal with this and alleviate this, both with individual and collective means?

  <p>
    An important part of communication (where there's often a lot of room for improvement) is listening. Listening is about more than just opening your ears. How can you approach listening so that the other person feels heard and understood? What techniques are helpful for this? How do you listen in such a way that the other person is afterwards receptive to what you want to say?

Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris
Italiam, fato profugus, Laviniaque venit
litora, multum ille et terris iactatus et alto
vi superum saevae memorem Iunonis ob iram;
multa quoque et bello passus, dum conderet urbem,
inferretque deos Latio, genus unde Latinum,
Albanique patres, atque altae moenia Romae.
Musa, mihi causas memora, quo numine laeso,
quidve dolens, regina deum tot volvere casus
insignem pietate virum, tot adire labores
impulerit. Tantaene animis caelestibus irae?
