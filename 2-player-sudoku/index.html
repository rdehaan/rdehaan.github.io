            <p>
              With these 2-player Sudoku puzzles you can combine the fun of
              solving Sudoku puzzles with the joy of collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>
              You solve Sudoku puzzles together.
              Both players pick a Sudoku puzzle of their own preferred level.
              There are two highlighted cells in the two chosen Sudoku puzzles,
              each with their own shading/color.
              These cells must get the same value in both players' puzzle.
              Once you found the value for one of these cells
              (or that this cell cannot contain a certain value),
              tell the other player.
              You need each other to fully complete both puzzles.
            </p>
